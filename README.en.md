Data-Driven Chemistry is a collection of learning material for an introductory Python course for undergraduate chemistry students. The presented material here serves as a public version of [Data-Driven Chemistry](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/22-23/dpt/cxchem08031.htm) as taught at the University of Edinburgh in the School of Chemistry.

## Dependencies and Installation

This project uses the Python programming language, and requires Python >= 3.9.

Units will require different packages from the scientific Python ecosystem. The easiest way to install dependencies is using the Anaconda distribution, otherwise the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file also summarises the needed packages. 

Units are written and available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). If you just want to get started with the Units use the links to the CoLab notebooks provided. Otherwise you can follow these steps to get your local environment setup:

1. Get your anaconda distribution setup. See [here](https://datacarpentry.org/2016-05-29-PyCon/install.html) for detailed instructions.
2. Open a terminal or anaconda promt.
2. Create an environment using the following command
	
	```
	conda create -n ddc python=3.9
	```
	
3. Activate the environment and install the required packages into it:
	
	``` 
	conda activate ddc
	conda install jupyter pandas scipy nglview==3.0.3 ipywidgets==7.6.0 pint mendeleev vpython matplotlib jupyter-server==1.23.6
	```
	
4. Now you can start your Jupyter notebooks as:
	
	```
	jupyter notebook Unit_01/Unit_01_problem_solving_I.ipynb
	```

## Getting started with the material

This [overview](overview.md) document will give you an idea of how to engage with the material either as a student or instructor. Please read this first before getting started.

RS taught one unit and created content for it in 2020/21, when the course was run in a shortened form as a replacement for physical chemistry laboratory practicals during the pandemic. MTD shared and adapted materials developed in 2018 for his course at Durham University aimed at chemistry research students, and made some additional contributions.

- JC: Created the material for `Unit_01`, `Unit_10`, and the helper_functions, gave feedback on other materials, and helped edit the manuscript.    
- MTD: Contributed material to `Unit_03`, `Unit_05`, `Unit_07`, and `Unit_08`, and helped edit the manuscript.    
- VE: Created material for `Unit_05` and `Unit_08`, contributed to `Unit_06`, and helped edit the manuscript.   
- JJG: Contributed material to `Unit_09`, and helped edit the manuscript.   
- CLH: Created material for `Unit_03` and `Unit_04`, and helped edit the manuscript.    
- ASJSM: Created material for `Unit_02`, `Unit_06`, `Unit_07`, and `Unit_09`, provided feedback and small contributions to most other units, and wrote the manuscript.   
- HP: Contributed material to `Unit_05` and `Unit_08`, and helped edit the manuscript.   
- RS: Created the material for molecular geometries forming part of `Unit_06` and gave feedback on the manuscript.   

## Acknowledgements

The authors would like to acknowledge the help of all the PhD student demonstrators on this course, who helped with assessment material, testing the course content and providing teaching assistance in the classes.

## Reusing and building on the material for your own course

The easiest way is by cloning the material and adapting it to your needs. This can be just using some partial material or expanding on the existing material. The best way to do this is by either [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the repo and building up on it, or using the current repository as a [template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for your own or your organisations GitHub account, for more details see the [overview](overview.md) document.
